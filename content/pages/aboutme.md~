Title: About Me
Date: 2013-04-18

### Hi, My name is Kython

Currently, I am a Phd-candidate in CAS, majored in opto-electronics.

I enjoy programming in my sparetime. Generally, I code in Mathematica (MMA) and Python, sometimes also Ruby and Javascript.
Writing in markdown or LaTeX is tons of fun for me.
I am interested in a wide spetrum of emerging technologies, i.e., machine learning, image processing, internet of things, etc.

- 2014-08-22: Github pages ignite my passion to design my own website myself.
At the very begging, this blog was powered by HEXO for its simplicity.
- 2015-03-10: Early in this year, I was attracted by Pelican for the reason that it is powered by Python which is my favorate.
Finnaly, I rewrited this website using Pelican and Bootstrap.

I'd like to share my learning experience, as well as some heartful things with you at this blog.
